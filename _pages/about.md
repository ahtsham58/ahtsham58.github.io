Hi, I’m <b>Ahtsham Manzoor</b> — an Applied AI Scientist and lifelong technologist, fascinated by how ideas can evolve into intelligent systems that make life easier, smoother, and more meaningful.
<br><br>

From an early age, I was drawn to science. Choosing pre-engineering in high school felt like destiny. After a highly competitive examination process, I was admitted in 2011 to the BS Computer Science program at a prestigious public engineering institute — <a href="https://uet.edu.pk/" target="_blank">University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore</a>. 
<br><br>

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience and began my career as a Software Developer (Intern) in 2014. 
My journey grew from solving problems in large codebases; exploring/debugging/coding tens of thousands of lines of code and hundreds of SQL tables.  
However, the curiosity to learn more led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</a>, focusing on data science and machine learning.  
Imagine implementing neural networks and machine learning models in Matlab — without modern libraries! :p  
<br><br>


After completing my Master’s thesis in 2017, my curiosity to advance Data Science transformed into an R&D passion.  
<br><br>
In 2019, I joined the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/" target="_blank">University of Klagenfurt</a>, Austria, 
as a Senior Scientist at the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/" target="_blank">Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity (AICS)</a>. 
Within the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/isys/" target="_blank">Information Systems Research Group</a>, 
I investigated natural language generation (e.g., GPT, BERT, Transformers, RNNs, GNNs) and retrieval-based methods for the <i>conversational recommendation problem</i>, 
with a particular focus on their effectiveness in terms of quality and usability from a <b>human-centric</b> standpoint. 
<br>

In 2023, this work led to my PhD project conclusion in Applied AI (ML/NLP/UX), with <b>10+ peer-reviewed publications</b>.  
In essence, it was a transformative journey, where in addition to the persuit of becoming an <i>independent researcher</i>, 
I explored how humans interact with multi-turn conversational agents like <i>ChatGPT</i> — and how technology can feel more natural, predictable, and human-intuitive. 
<br><br>

Over the past decade, I’ve been fortunate to work across research labs, startups, and global enterprises in domains such as travel & insurance, media, auto finance, e-commerce, 
and enterprise digital/data platforms.  From acquring scientific exposure to practical problem solving, 
I see myself as a <b>scientific liaison</b> between R&D, engineering, and design; eager to apply what I’ve refined over the years on a broader, practical scale, while learning from others, upscaling expertise, and creating impact. 
<br><br>

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of <i>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
and Human-Computer Interaction (assistive technologies, human factors, UX)</i>.  
  
<br><br>


<div style="text-align: center;">
Topics that excites me the most:

</div>
<br><br>

Outside of work, I enjoy sightseeing, traveling, and exploring multi-cuisine food.  
Have something serious to discuss? Just offer me a nice coffee! ☕
