<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Hello, I'm a dedicated young researcher with a strong passion for cutting-edge AI technologies 
that prioritize human-centric solutions. My academic background is rooted in Computer Science, 
and I have a history of actively contributing to various R&D projects.

Previously, I served as a Senior Scientist at the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/"> Institute of Artificial Intelligence 
and Cyber Security (AICS) </a>
at the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/"> University of Klagenfurt </a>, Austria, where I also completed my Ph.D. in 2023. During my doctoral studies, 
I authored 10 peer-reviewed publications, focusing on conversational recommender systems designed to assist users 
in finding relevant items and making informed decisions using natural language interfaces.


My primary research interests encompass Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
and User Experience (UX) research. I am committed to advancing these interdisciplinary fields 
to create technology that is more intuitive, efficient, and tailored to the needs of individuals and society.


At the core of my work is the belief that computer sciences should aim to enhance the lives of people. 
Recognizing the intrinsic link between technology and humanity, I view human-centered computing not merely 
as a field of study, but as a broader mission.


Currently, my research is centered around the extensive exploration of large language models (LLMs) 
with a specific focus on their societal impact and influence on individuals.  
Furthermore, I actively engage in collaborative research projects with 
esteemed international scholars, involved into areas such as recommender systems, human-computer interactions, 
and broader topics in artificial intelligence, generative AI, and LLMs.
