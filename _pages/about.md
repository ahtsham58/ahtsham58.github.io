Hi! I am Ahtsham, a Pre-doc scientist at the University of Klagenfurt, in the department of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security (AICS), Austria.
I am an enthusiast technologist who loves developing and producing human-centric technologies with a background in computer sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in research and development (R&D) based projects for multiple international organizations. My research, teaching, and broader IT professional expertise are all grounded
in the idea that science produces technology, and technology is made up for humans. This human element is contingent on technology, and when there are humans, psychology is there. That makes human-centered-computing, not a field rather objective.


Research Interests
======
My main research interests lie in the cross-sectional areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-centered-computing (HCI). Specifically, I work on information systems, conversational recommender systems, natural language processing, user modeling, etc. Moreover, I investigate, and research applied computer science for applications such as e-commerce, social media, banking & lease, insurance.
Mainly, in my research, I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational research methods to investigate and evaluate the research objectives.



Background and Life
======
Currently, I am a Ph.D. scholar striving to complete my doctoral thesis requirements at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria.
I received my Masters (MA) degree from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Pakistan, and bachelor's degree from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore.
In my professional career, I worked in the IT industry for multiple national and international companies and later involved myself to research. I worked as a researcher in LUMS, which broadened my goals to pursue Doctorate.
From time to time, I am occupied as a technology consultant for providing my services in the development of both IT projects and business models. This is one of the interesting hobbies I enjoy while working on complex problems to their solutions. In my spare time, I love to go for a walk around natural beauty sights and enjoy coffee there.
