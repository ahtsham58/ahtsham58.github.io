<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Hello, I'm a dedicated young researcher/technologist with a strong passion for cutting-edge human-centric AI and Digital technologies. 
Over the years, I have designed and contirbuted to several IT projects spanning over mobile, desktop, and web applications
My academic background is rooted in Computer Science, and have a history of actively contributing to conferences, meetups, and talks, as I belive learning never exausts the mind. <br>

Previously, I served as a Senior Scientist at the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/"> Institute of Artificial Intelligence 
and Cyber Security (AICS) </a>
at the <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/"> University of Klagenfurt </a>, Austria, where I also completed my Ph.D. in 2023. During my doctoral studies, 
I authored 10 peer-reviewed publications, focusing on conversational recommender systems designed to assist users 
in finding relevant items and making informed decisions using natural language interfaces (chatbots). <br> <br>


My primary research interests encompass <i>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
and User Experience (UX)</i> research. I am committed to advancing these interdisciplinary fields 
to create technology that is more intuitive, efficient, and tailored to the needs of individuals and society. <br>


At the core of my work is the belief that computer sciences should aim to enhance the lives of people. 
Recognizing the intrinsic relation between technology and humanity, I believe human-centered computing not merely 
a field of study, but a <i>broader mission</i>. <br> <br>


Currently, my work is centered around the extensive exploration of <i>large language models (LLMs)</i> 
with a specific focus on their societal impact and influence on individuals.  In addition, I'm involved in various activties like commencing generative AI use-cases, their solutions, and impact.
Furthermore, I'm actively engaging in collaborative research projects with 
esteemed international scholars and practioners. <br>
