Hi! I am a Pre-doc scientist at [Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security (AICS)](https://www.aau.at/en/aics/), [University of Klagenfurt](https://www.aau.at/en/), Austria.
I am an enthusiast technologist who loves developing and producing human-centric technologies with a background in computer sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in industrial, research and development (R&D) based projects for various international organizations. My research, teaching, and broader IT professional expertise are all grounded
in the idea that computer-science produces technology, and technology is for humans. This human element is contingent on technology, and when there are humans, psychology is there. That makes human-centered-computing, not a field rather objective.


Research Interests
======
My main research interests lie in the cross-sectional areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and human-centered-computing (HCI). Specifically, I work on information systems, conversational recommender systems, information retrieval, language generation, personlization, etc. Moreover, as an IT professional, I have worked on applications such as e-commerce, social media, banking & lease, insurance, etc.
Mainly, in my research, I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational research methods to investigate and evaluate the research objectives with a focus on involving humans in the evaluation process.



Background and Life
======
Born in a village of central Punjab, Pakistan, where we used to sit on the ground in our early education classes and throughly enjoyed that period of life due to its similicity and traditions. 
Later on, I moved to  Lahore (capital of Punjab) and earned my Bachelor's degree from the [University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/) (a premier public sector university) in Pakistan.
Then, to grasp the in depth-knowledge of computer science and experience research process, went for Master's (MA) degree to the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/), Pakistan, a top-class instituion. 
Usually, I spend me spare in traveling and walking around natural beauty sights and enjoy coffee as this is one of hobbies that's hard to change. Moreover, I enjoy reading books and articles particularly on human psyschology, technology, life aspects, etc.
From time to time, I am occupied as a technology consultant for providing my services in the development of both IT projects and business models. This is something I enjoy while working on real-world complex problems and finding their solutions.
