<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Hi, I am a Senior scientist at the institute of <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/"> Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security 
(AICS)</a>, <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/">University of Klagenfurt</a>, Austria. An enthusiast technologist who 
loves developing and producing human-centric AI technologies with a background in Computer Sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in industrial and R&D based projects for various 
international organizations. The foundation of my work, encompassing AI research, teaching, and broader IT exposure, 
is based on the principle that computer sciences creates technology for humans. 
By acknowledging the intrinsic relationship between technology and humans, to me
it is obvious that human-centered computing is not just a field of study, but an overarching objective.<br />

from the <a href="https://www.uet.edu.pk"> University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore</a>, Pakistan.
Then, to grasp the in-depth knowledge of computer science, in particular, data science, 
I joined <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</a>, Pakistan for the Master's (MS) degree. In 2019, I moved to Austria. 


Usually, I spend my spare time in walking around natural beauty sights with a cup of coffee.
