Hi, I’m Ahtsham Manzoor — an Applied AI Scientist and lifelong technologist who's always been fascinated by how ideas can turn into intelligent systems making life easier, smooth and meaningful.
 <br> <br>


I started my career as a Software Engineer, solving problems while enhancing/creating huge codebases containing ten of thousands code lines and hunderds of SQL Tables. 
That curiosity led me to pursue Masters' Program in Computer Sciences to dive deep into the realm of data science and machine learning. Imagine implementing neural networks in matlab, that without libraries :p

After my Masters' thesis work, the curisosity to advancing Data Science knowledge further tunred into R&D interest.

 <br>

In 2019, I joined University of Klagenfurt, Austria, as a Senior Scientist at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber security (AICS). During my stay at Information Systems research group, I investigated language generation and retrieval-based methods in terms of their impact on the quality and 
usabaility of conversational recommender systems. This journey led me to earning a PhD degree in the Applied AI (ML/NLP/UX) domain with 10+ peer-reviewed publications. 
In essence, it turned out to be a great journey where I explored how people interact with intelligent conversational systems 
and technology can feel more natural, predictable, and human intutive.



 <br><br>
Over the past decade, I’ve been lucky to work across research labs, startups, and global enterprises in areas like travel, leasing & finance, e-commerce, and enterprise digital/data platforms. 
I see myself as a scientific liaison between R&D, engineering, and design — eager to apply what I’ve learned and refined over the years on a broader, practical scale, while learing from others, upscalling expertise and creating impact.

 <br> <br>
My primary research interests lies at the intersection of <i>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
and Human-computer Interaction (assistive technologies, human factors, UX)</i>  research. In the below figure, I mentioned what excites me to get on.

Outside of work, I love staying curious about things such as sightseeing, travel, and multi-cusine food. Have something serious to talk about? Offer me a nice cofee!
