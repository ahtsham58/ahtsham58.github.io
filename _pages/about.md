Hi! I am a Pre-doc scientist at [Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security (AICS)](https://www.aau.at/en/aics/), [University of Klagenfurt](https://www.aau.at/en/), Austria.
I am an enthusiast technologist who loves developing and producing human-centric technologies with a background in computer sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in industrial, research and development (R&D) based projects for various international organizations. My research, teaching, and broader IT professional expertise are all grounded
in the idea that computer-science produces technology, and technology is for humans. This human element is contingent on technology, and when there are humans, psychology is there. That makes human-centered-computing, not a field rather objective.


Research Interests
======
My main research interests lie in the cross-sectional areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and human-centered-computing (HCI). Specifically, I work on information systems, conversational recommender systems, information retrieval, language generation, personlization, etc. Moreover, as an IT professional, I have worked on applications such as e-commerce, social media, banking & lease, insurance, etc.
Mainly, in my research, I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational research methods to investigate and evaluate the research objectives with a focus on involving humans in the evaluation process.



Background and Life
======
Currently, I am a Ph.D. scholar at the [University of Klagenfurt] (https://www.aau.at/en/), Austria.
I received my Masters (MA) degree from [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/), Pakistan, and Bachelor's degree from the [University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/), Pakistan.
Usually, I spend me spare in traveling and walking around natural beauty sights and enjoy coffee there as this is one of hobbies that's hard to change. Moreover, I read books and articles particularly on human psyschology, technology, life aspects, etc.
From time to time, I am occupied as a technology consultant for providing my services in the development of both IT projects and business models. This is one of the interesting hobbies I enjoy while working on complex problems and finding their solutions.
