<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a Pre-doc scientist at the institute of <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/"> Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security 
(AICS)</a>, <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/">University of Klagenfurt</a>, Austria. An enthusiast technologist who 
loves developing and producing human-centric technologies with a background in Computer Sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in industrial and R&D based projects for various 
international organizations. My research, teaching, and broader IT professional expertise are all grounded
on the idea that computer-science produces technology, and technology is for humans. Since this human element is 
contingent to technology, I presume where there are humans, psychology is there, which 
makes human-centered-computing not a field rather objective.

Research Interests
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
My main research interests lie in the cross-sectional areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, User-Experience, and Human-centered Computing (HCI). 

</div>

Background and Life
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Born in Pakistan, where we used to sit on the ground in our early education 
classes and throughly enjoyed that period of life due to its similicity and traditions.
In 2011, I moved to  Lahore (capital of Punjab) and earned my Bachelor's degree 
from the <a href="https://www.uet.edu.pk"> University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore </a> ,Pakistan.
Then, to grasp the in-depth knowledge of computer science and to experience research process, 
went for Master's (MS) degree to <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</a>, 
Pakistan. In 2019, I moved to Austria for my doctorate degree. 


Usually, I spend me spare time in walking around natural beauty sights with a cup of coffee. 
Moreover, I enjoy reading books and articles particularly on human psyschology, 
technology, life aspects, etc.
