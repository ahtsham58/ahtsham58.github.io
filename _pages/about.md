<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a Pre-doc scientist at the institute of <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/aics/"> Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security 
(AICS)</a>, <a href="https://www.aau.at/en/">University of Klagenfurt</a>, Austria. An enthusiast technologist who 
loves developing and producing human-centric technologies with a background in Computer Sciences.
Previously, I enjoyed my involvement in industrial and R&D based projects for various 
international organizations. My research, teaching, and broader IT exposure are all grounded
on the idea that computer-science produces technology, and technology is for humans. Since this human element is 
contingent to technology, I presume where there are humans, psychology is there, which 
makes human-centered-computing not a field rather objective.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Born in Pakistan in a town located at the centere of punjab province.
In 2011, I moved to  Lahore and earned my Bachelor's degree 
from the <a href="https://www.uet.edu.pk"> University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore</a>, Pakistan.
Then, to grasp the in-depth knowledge of computer science and to experience the research process, 
I joined <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)</a>, Pakistan for the Master's (MS) degree. In 2019, I moved to Austria. 


Usually, I spend my spare time in walking around natural beauty sights with a cup of coffee. 
Moreover, I enjoy reading books and articles particularly on human psyschology, 
technology, life aspects, etc.
